// NOTE: This file is intentionally left as a small shim to preserve the
// original module layout in case other parts of the codebase reference
// `crate::app::mod` directly. The real implementation now lives in
// `src/app.rs` and the `app/check.rs` and `app/metrics.rs` helper files.

// Deprecated placeholder to avoid duplicate definitions during refactor.
// The build will use `src/app.rs` as the authoritative implementation.
